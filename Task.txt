2. Give a write-up on the Difference between copy by value and copy by reference.

  Copy by Value:
 -----------------
        --> Copy by values takes place in primitive data types where values are directly copied to new variables
	--> Changes takes place in one does not effect another one
           
                EX: 
               ----
                     var n = 10
                     var x = n
                     console.log(x,n) o/p=> 10 10(because data present in n i.e 10 which is directly copied to x)
 

 Copy by Reference:
---------------------
	--> Copy by reference takes place in non-primitive data types where values are not copied directly instead it copies address of the memory location
           
              EX:
 	     ----
		var user = {name:"Rohith",age:24}
 		var admin = user;		
		admin.name = "Changed"
		console.log(user.name) o/p => Changed (because we are updating the name in the address so the user object will get effected)


 3) How to copy by value a composite datatype

				There are 3 ways to copy by value for composite data types.
				=> Using the spread (...) operator
				=> Using the Object.assign() method
				=> Using the JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() methods
